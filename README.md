# extractor
An Octave based feature extractor and encoder

The Extractor project has been developed as a platform for exploration of supervised feature extraction as it relates to Artificial Neural Networks. The primary goal of this project is to extract useful features from a subset of the training data and then encode these feature into a Convolutional Neural Network layer. 

In order to determing the efficacy of the employed encoding, the output of this project (a ANN layer) may be directly compared to the performance of a traditionally trained layer of similar size against a benchmark data set such as MNIST. For this functionality see the EvalNets project at https://github.com/kotulc/evalnets

For more detail concerning this project, please take a look at the documentation.
